As the title suggests, this week I discovered there's no need to build in a core memory feature. I originally thought this would shape the core identity of the personality. I have learned that chat histories are stored in Ollama. Running a local instance works in my favour here. 
I was researching more models too, Gemma2:2b appears to be the quickest and best output on my resource limited laptop so I'm going to roll with it for now.
I've worked a bit on it this week, I didn't get as much completed as I would have liked.\
I'll likely have something cool to show in next weeks blog post.
